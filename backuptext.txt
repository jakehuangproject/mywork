                                An animation created using Vectorworks and Twinmotion. Collecting all dimensions from real space, and then transform the original Survey Model into any kind of renovation I desire.

                            <p>
                                Spotting Fake News is an interactive project designed to educate and inform people about the detrimental effects of fake news on the internet. There are slices that show how the fake news has been spreading and the consequences of spreading bias news.

                            <p>
                                This is a wearable design that can sense people’s heart beats by a pulse sensor. Our goal of this project is to make a code that Neopixels flashes when every pulse period is finished.

                                A seventy-six-second animated infographic that explores the topic of plastic pollution. The task is to balance the use of kinetic typography with the use of graphics.

                                The goal of the project was to develop an application prototype that would help alleviate an equity issue in universities.The pressing issue that I chose was the high costs of textbooks.

                                This project consists of three parts: creative brief, logo design and packaging design for a pasta packaging. Besides designing an attractive appearance for packaging, the designer must consider the evaluate the cost and think about the packaging’s sustainability.

                                For this project I use sketching, drafting, and eventually modeling with a CAD/BIM program to create a dwelling unit for the Airbnb competition.  I decided to convey the theme of nature in my project, and I utilize a  curved shape as the house’s roof and decorations to create little wave shapes.

                                wildfires are quickly becoming a yearly environmental threat.  I would like to use this project to create a mini-game to raise awareness of the dangers. I use sketching to get the initial idea, and eventually do the coding process with Processing.
