			<h1>Book Dealer</h1>
			<div class="iframe-container">
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nytrA7vBXV8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

				Book Dealer was a design project that I designed to help college students have better access to buy low costs of textbooks.The app prototype was inspired by Netflix, a prepaid subscription service that allows users to watch unlimited TV shows and movies on all devices. The advantages of subscription-based apps are cheaper costs for the subscription fee and that the user can watch a lot of content. Therefore, I decided to develop a subscription-based app for this project.
			</p> 
			<p>
				<storng class="bolder">Tools Used</storng>: Adobe XD & Adobe After Effects </br> <storng class="bolder">Product Type</storng>: Product/ UX Design, Interface Design
			</p></br>
			<h2>The Prompt</h2>
			<p>
				Design and prototype an app that solves an equity-related issue.
			</p></br>
			<h2>The Process</h2>
			<p>
				<storng class="bolder">Problem Identification</storng></br>
				It has become so prevalent that students in college must buy several books in a quarter/semester if he/she is a full-time student. However, some textbooks are very expensive, and after using these textbooks for a semester/quarter, the students might not use it again. Additionally, if the students keep the textbook at the bookshelf for a long time, the price would become lower and lower if they want to sell the book. Therefore, I would like to find a way to solve the problem of high costs of textbooks.
			</p>
			<p>
				<storng class="bolder">SWOT Analysis</storng></br>				
				• Strengths: For consumers, this app gives the ability to students to choose a plan according to their needs. The cost of the subscription fee in the app is cheaper than buying a new book. students can read books on all of the user's devices.
			</p>
			<p>
				• Weaknesses: This is a new app to many consumers, users might not know how the app if the app can benefit them.
			</p>
			<p>
				• Opportunities: There were very few similar apps in the US, so it could be a new consumption model for both users and sellers. I was aware of so many students complaining of the expensive textbook. If there was an app that could provide a lower cost of textbooks, they would be more likely to purchase a book with cheaper prices.
			</p>
			<p>
				<storng class="bolder">Interview</storng></br>				
				Some students would love to use this subscription-based for buying textbooks because they can get books with lower price. However, some students would not use an app like that because some of them are afraid to use a new app like this.
			</p>
			<p>
				My uncle who is an owner of a toy factory mentions that the sellers might not accept this kind of deal because students only buy textbooks twice or three times a year. The sellers might not easily give the cheap prices to students.

			</p>
			<p>
				What I learned was that the app that has a unique feature is not enough, I needed to think if the feature is approachable. Otherwise, even though there is a unique feature, no one would use it. Additionally, I must do more research about how other similar apps work.
			</p></br>
			<h2>Prototype</h2>
			<p>
				• Becoming a Member :  During this task, the user can review the details of the subscription service such as the number of books that can be read and the price of the plans. The colorful design makes this page more appealing. It also conveys the message that the plan is a valuable and premium choice.
				<div class="pair_out">
					<div class="pair"><img src="./images/app/home.jpg" alt="Typeface1" class="img_inpage2" id="imageSize"></div>
				
					<div class="pair"><img src="./images/app/member.jpg" alt="Typeface2" class="img_inpage2 borader"   id="imageSize"></div>
				</div>
			</p>
			<p>
				• Saving a Book to the "Library" : The user can find the search bar at the top section of the home page. When the user reviews a book's information, the app will show two different prices: the original price and the membership price. This comparison enables the user to discover the price advantage of the app.
				<div class="pair_out">
					<div class="pair"><img src="./images/app/library.jpg" alt="Typeface1" class="img_inpage2 borader" id="imageSize"></div>
				
					<div class="pair"><img src="./images/app/savingBooks.jpg" alt="Typeface2" class="img_inpage2 borader"   id="imageSize"></div>
				</div>
			</p>
			<p>
				• Viewing the Testimonial Section : besides using the search bar, the user can also add a book by clicking on the picture or text of the book. The user can look at customer reviews in the testimonial section.

			<h2>Usability Report of Book Dealer</h2>
			<p>
				<storng class="bolder">Audience</storng></br>	
				Because the target audiences of the app are college students. After I made the prototype,
				I sent the link of the app to five students at UC Davis whose majors are design, math,
				computer science, art history and biology.
			</p>
			<p>
				<storng class="bolder">Tasks</storng></br>	
				• Getting either quarterly or annual plan.</br>
				• Saving a book to the library.</br>
				• Reading a book saved in library.</br>
				• Reviewing people’s feedback about the book and the experience of the app.</br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<storng class="bolder">Strengths</storng></br>	
				The app provides different plan for students, so they just need to buy a plan according
				to what they need. For example: quarterly plan is provided 6 digital books every 3
				months.The student who tested the app feel pleased that the cost of the
				a subscription-based app is much cheaper than buying a new book. Furthermore, ebook
				in the app can be read on any mobile devices. Additionally, there would be no more a
				pile of book storing at home.
			</p>
			<p>
				<storng class="bolder">Usability problems</storng></br>	
				• When the user read a book in the app, they hoped the screen could switch to a more comfortable color or background.
			</p>
			<p>
				Solution: I added a paper-liked texture background which can make the reader read more comfortable.
			</p>
			<p>
				• A user reflected that if she finished reading a book, she didn’t  know that this book was already read. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Solution: I added a section called “finished book” in the library section, so the book that has been read would go to this section automatically.
			</p>
			<p>
				• Another user found that he only can add books on the home page, so he felt that he doesn’t like to go back and forth. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Solution: I built an “add book” button in the library, so users could add books at the either homepage and library.
			</p></br>
			<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
			<p>
				I gained valuable experience in building a digital product from Adobe XD for the first time. I realized that the most important part of user experience is not about how beautiful the interface looks, but about a person’s using experience and attitudes towards interacting with the product itself. UI/UX design is 60% user research and 40% beautiful design. During my user testing phase, most of my users pointed out small nuances and frustration they had while testing the prototype. I would not notice certain usability issues because it is difficult to catch your own mistakes if you have been the one constantly staring at the interface design. It is hard to catch your own mistakes. I realize the importance of user testing with at least 6 people. Overall, I learned a lot about the entire workflow and processes that are needed to create an efficient product that users can satisfyingly use. Also, designers need to focus on what problems need to be solved.
